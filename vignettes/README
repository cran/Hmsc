## BUILDING VIGNETTES

The distributed package vignettes use real scale analysis, and
rebuilding all vignettes may take several hours or even days depending
on your computer system and its load. Therefore the vignettes are not
regularly re-built from the source (`.Rmd`) files. See vignette date
which shows when the vignette was built.

You can rebuild the vignette using `rmarkdown::render()` command. If
you just want to have a quick test of building vignette or to just
familiarize with basic `Hmsc` commands, you can edit the source file
to use argument `test.run=TRUE`. With this argument, only short chains
are run, and the build is fast, but the results are not reliable. To
replicate the binary (`.pdf`) vignette, you should use
`test.run=FALSE`.
